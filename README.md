#### _Build a restaurant reviews app_

## Project Overview: 

After cloning/downloading/forking the Udacity project [mws-restaurant-stage-1](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1), these tasks were given:

1. Get an API key from either MapBox or Google Maps
   - I chose MapBox, because you have to register a payment card with Google (since summer 2018).

2. Place the key in the correct places in 2 of the files

3. Convert the site to responsive design using CSS

4. Implement accessibility attributes

5. Add a ServiceWorker script 
   - Only caching is necessary


### What do I do from here?

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
I used Python, and though I never even touched Python before in my life I could do it. So can you!

Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/).
Hint: I found the process further easier if I installed it directly to **c:/Python/**.

Next, in your shell (like Git Bash), type: `export PATH="$PATH:/c/Python"` to let your shell know where to find Python.
You can now type `python -V` to check your version of Python.
Lastly, type `python -m http.server 8000` - now you have made your own local server in port 8000.
In your web browser (use Chrome!) you can now type `localhost:8000` in the address bar.

Finished!
